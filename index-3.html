      <p>Hundrends of years ago, women were supposed to be both moral wifes and caring mothers. They were expected to cook, swipe and spend their whole lives inside a house, serving others. </p>
        <p>This happend not only then, but also nowadays. The vast majority of women hit the glass ceilling as far as their job is concearned... </p>
<p>However, there were brave women who weren't afraid of following their dreams.</p>

      <h4>Who Was Marie Curie?</h4>
      <p>Born Maria Sklodowska on November 7, 1867, Marie Curie became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the first person—man or woman—to win the award twice. Curie's efforts, with her husband Pierre Curie, led to the discovery of polonium and radium and, after Pierre's death, the further development of X-rays. The famed scientist died on July 4, 1934. </p>
      <h4>What Did Marie Curie Discover?</h4>
      <p>Marie Curie discovered radioactivity, and, together with her husband Pierre, the radioactive elements polonium and radium, while working with the mineral pitchblende.</p>
<p>Fascinated with the work of Henri Becquerel, a French physicist who discovered that uranium casts off rays weaker than the X-rays found by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen, Marie Curie took his work a few steps further. Curie conducted her own experiments on uranium rays and discovered that they remained constant, no matter the condition or form of the uranium. The rays, she theorized, came from the element's atomic structure. This revolutionary idea created the field of atomic physics. Curie herself coined the word "radioactivity" to describe the phenomena.</p>
<p>Following Marie’s discovery of radioactivity, she continued her research with her husband. Working with the mineral pitchblende, the pair discovered a new radioactive element in 1898. They named the element polonium, after Marie's native country of Poland. They also detected the presence of another radioactive material in the pitchblende, and called that radium. In 1902, the Curies announced that they had produced a decigram of pure radium, demonstrating its existence as a unique chemical element.</p>

<h4>Education</h4>
<p>A top student in her secondary school, Curie could not attend the men's-only University of Warsaw. She instead continued her education in Warsaw's "floating university," a set of underground, informal classes held in secret. Both Curie and her sister Bronya dreamed of going abroad to earn an official degree, but they lacked the financial resources to pay for more schooling. Undeterred, Curie worked out a deal with her sister. She would work to support Bronya while she was in school and Bronya would return the favor after she completed her studies. For roughly five years, Curie worked as a tutor and a governess. She used her spare time to study, reading about physics, chemistry and math.</p>

<p>In 1891, Curie finally made her way to Paris and enrolled at the Sorbonne. She threw herself into her studies, but this dedication had a personal cost. With little money, Curie survived on buttered bread and tea, and her health sometimes suffered because of her poor diet. Curie completed her master's degree in physics in 1893 and earned another degree in mathematics the following year.</p>
<br>
<h2>Nobel Prizes</h2>
<p>Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the first person—man or woman—to win the prestigious award twice. She remains the only one to be honored for accomplishments in two separate sciences.</p>

<p>In 1903, Curie received the Nobel Prize in Physics, along with her husband and Henri Becquerel, for their work on radioactivity. With their win, the Curies developed an international reputation for their scientific efforts, and they used their prize money to continue their research.</p>

<p>In 1911, Curie won her second Nobel Prize, this time in Chemistry, for her discovery of radium and polonium. While she received the prize alone, she shared the honor jointly with her late husband in her acceptance lecture. Around this time, Curie joined with other famous scientists, including Albert Einstein and Max Planck, to attend the first Solvay Congress in Physics and discuss the many groundbreaking discoveries in their field.</p>
<h2>X-rays and Later Research</h2>
<p>When World War I broke out in 1914, Curie devoted her time and resources to helping the cause. She championed the use of portable X-ray machines in the field, and these medical vehicles earned the nickname "Little Curies." After the war, Curie used her celebrity to advance her research. She traveled to the United States twice—in 1921 and in 1929—to raise funds to buy radium and to establish a radium research institute in Warsaw.</p>

<p>“The use of the X-rays during the war saved the lives of many wounded men; it also saved many from long suffering and lasting infirmity.” — Marie Curie</p>

<h2>How and When Did Marie Curie Die?</h2>
<p>Marie Curie died on July 4, 1934, of aplastic anemia, believed to be caused by prolonged exposure to radiation. She was known to carry test tubes of radium around in the pocket of her lab coat, and her many years working with radioactive materials took a toll on her health.</p>
